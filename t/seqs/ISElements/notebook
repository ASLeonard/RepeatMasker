is1.fa: Insertion Sequence Tests

   seq1: Contains a complete IS1 element (n-bp) inside a n-bp
         sequence.  There is a 7bp identical flanking sequence 
         on either side of the IS1 element.  Valid IS1 elements
         are flanked by 8, 9, or 10bp identical flanking sequences
         so this is an ify match.  The correct action would be
         to warn the user of this match and not remove it.

   seq2: The same sequence as above + an extra base on each 
         flanking sequence bringing it to a total of 8bp.  This
         one should be cliped out including one side of the
         flanking duplication leaving n-bp of sequence.
