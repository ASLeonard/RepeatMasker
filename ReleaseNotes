4.1.0
  - Refactored the RepeatMasker configuration system.  
    The changes make it easier to automate installation and/or
    bundle RepeatMasker.

4.0.9-p2
  - Another improvement in TRF error handling

4.0.9-p1 : Tue Apr 16 08:51:22 PDT 2019
  - Input files containing multiple FASTA sequences
    caused RepeatMasker to error out with a message
    like:

      "WARNING: TRF returned an error (Return code = ### )
       TRF parameters: 2.7.7.80.10.50.10
       A search phase could not complete on this batch.
       The batch file will be re-run and if possible the
       program will resume.
       WARNING: Retrying batch ( 1 ) [ 255,, 195]..."

    This bug was introduced in an attempt to improve TRF
    error catching.  Unfortunatly the return codes are
    not documented for TRF and the assumption that 256
    is the only successful return code is wrong.  The
    "success" code appears to change depending on the
    number of sequences in the file.  The workaround is
    to fail only if there is a message in the error output
    file.
