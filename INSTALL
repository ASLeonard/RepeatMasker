Pre-requisites
--------------

  - A UNIX based operating system.

  - Perl 5.8.0 or higher installed.

  - TRF 4.09 or higher ( http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html )
  
  - A search engine.  We currently support:

       crossmatch : http://www.phrap.org
       rmblast :  http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMBlast.html
       nhmmer : Pre release version - 
              ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/pickup/hmmer3.1-snap20121016.1.tgz 
              ( Dfam required )
       abblast/wublast : http://blast.advbiocomp.com/licensing/

  - Dfam and/or RepeatMasker libraries.  The curated families from
    Dfam 3.1 are included in this release. Updates and the complete
    (curated & uncrated) Dfam libraries can be found at: www.dfam.org.
    The RepBase RepeatMasker Library can be obtained at: 
    http://www.girinst.org
       

Installation 
------------

  1. Unpack the files to the directory you wish to install
     them in.

  2. [optional] Download the complete Dfam ( curated & uncurated )
     library "dfam.h5" ( famdb HDF5 format ) from www.dfam.org and
     replace the curated-only file in the Libraries directory.
  
  3. [optional] Download the last verion RepBase RepeatMasker
     Edition and unpack in the RepeatMasker directory.  This will
     create files in the Libraries subdiretory ready for merging
     with the Dfam library.  Run ./addRepBase.  This will merge 
     RepBase RepeatMasker Edition (RMRBMeta.embl and RMRBSeqs.embl)
     with Dfam.h5, and writes it the main RepeatMasker 
     library (RepeatMaskerLib.h5).

  4. Configure the distribution by invoking Perl on the
     the "configure" script, i.e.:
  
            perl ./configure

     The configure script will prompt you for all the
     information needed to setup the RepeatMasker suite of
     programs.



Library Cache Directories
-------------------------

Since version 3.0 RepeatMasker creates species-specific libraries
on the fly.  These libraries are cached in the first writable 
directory in the programs library path.  The default path is:

  1. The RepeatMasker installation "Library" directory.
  2. The ".RepeatMaskerCache" subdirectory of the users home
     directory.
  3. The temporary processing directory "RM_#" created
     in the same directory as the sequence file and 
     removed at the end of the run.
  
NOTE: If the program cannot save libraries in either path 1 or 2, the
libraries will need to be created each time the program runs.  This
will slow down runs on shorter sequences.
